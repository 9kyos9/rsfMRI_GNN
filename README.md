- **script/**: Contains MATLAB scripts for preprocessing the raw fMRI data using the CONN Toolbox.

- **src/**: Contains Python modules for feature extraction. These scripts are used to extract regional time series and generate functional connectivity (FC) matrices based on various brain atlases (e.g., AAL, Schaefer).

- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for the main analysis pipeline, which includes graph construction, GNN model training, and evaluation.
    - `fMRIGCN_w_knngraph_ensemble_hyperparametertuning_nestedCV.ipynb`: Implements the full GNN ensemble model with a robust hyperparameter tuning process using Nested Cross-Validation.
    - `fMRIGCN_w_knngraph_ensemble_no_hyperparametertuning.ipynb`: Implements the same pipeline but without hyperparameter tuning. These two notebooks are provided to directly compare and demonstrate the impact of hyperparameter tuning on model performance.
    - **Note on Model Implementation**: As the single-atlas models are the building blocks for the final ensemble model, they are implemented within both notebooks. Upon execution, the notebooks will output the evaluation results for the individual single-atlas models and the final ensemble model, allowing for a comprehensive performance comparison.
